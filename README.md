# PYTHON-Personalized-Learning-Program
Programming Logic and Design Laboratory course using Python language in Jupyter Notebook software.

## Introduction
Personalization in the context of personalized learning refers to pursuing progression which solely focuses on the individual’s needs and requirements. This puts premium on the demands of the individuals’ fluidity in their way of understanding and their choices. With learning, it is then the acquisition of knowledge from different kinds of sources. To fully state that an individual has learned a concept, he or she must be able to articulate the topic in his or her own words. This is one of the ways to fully determine if a student has fully grasped the topic. Combined, personalized learning pertains to a modified version of education with which the specific needs and goals of students are catered to, individually speaking, equating to a much more interactive and productive course of learning. This approach is aimed towards the elevation of literacy necessary for students, as individuals, in the status quo. Personalized learning systems, albeit difficult to create and much less optimize, have been a branch of education that has gained notable recognition in the context of digital learning. This environment of teaching assesses specific aspects of a student's learning techniques like one's analytical process and level of creativity. As this differs from person to person, it is imperative to create a learning interface that is adaptive and categorizes user-given results to create patterns and individualize diagnostic teaching methods. This serves as the primary motivation in the creation of this project, where it is expected to be able to classify a user's level of expertise in Python-specific programming and provide interactive modules based on it. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the details for each process from the conceptualization up to the actual application of the program. The following sections break down these elaborations based on specific topics to be discussed. Overall, the paper aims to paint a picture of the proposed project for the user, highlight important features, and discuss important details of the program in general
